      "I have to say PS3 is by far the best console ever created, I don't even know how people even consider having a Xbox, Wii I can understand, but PS3's 1080P resolution on a big screen Sony HD TV is unbeatable. I'm saying these things because this is a must have game for your PS3. This game looks very pretty, the images and colors are gorgeous and it really makes you appreciate your console.\n",
      "\n",
      "I love fighting games and I have to say most fighting games are best played with the D-Pad as opposed of the analog joystick. For example with Super Street Fighter IV Arcade Edition it is so hard to play with the joystick. This one is the other way around. I have been playing fighting games with the D-Pad since the 90s, and other than Tekken 5 Dark Resurrection I never thought I would love playing a game with the joystick, KOF XIII responds so well to the joystick that it becomes addictive. Even better is having an arcade stick controller to have the full game experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another great thing about this game are all the characters, they truly have picked the best characters from the wide range of awesome SNK fighting games, this game has absolutely the best ones, plus they all look awesome and very well drawn. The customization of colors is really good, but just the original look  of them is great. Except for Terry Bougard, for some reason they blow him way too much out of proportion, a leaner Terry Bougard was way cooler back in the day, but other than that, they are all cool, specially K' who is always the coolest.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall the game feels very complete, which is always a great thing, it has everything you wish from a fighting game, unlockables for playing the game (a nice high-def zoom-in gallery), story mode, arcade mode, practice mode, tutorial, versus mode (to enjoy fighting with your buddies), customizations, online mode, and even missions.\n",
      "\n",
      "The difficulty settings are perfect, it is very rare to find a game with accurate well thought out difficulty settings that actually respond well to your playing. That's something they did good in the previous one, I was afraid this one was going to be different, but it wasn't, this one is just as good, the playing has a great feel and it is not unrealistic at all, in fact it is just right, very hard is supposed to be very hard not impossible, other games fail in that, this one doesn't, they did a good job on that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Under missions there is an option where you can fight with all the characters until you run out of health, one fight at the time with one guy, like an endurance type of thing called survival. This is by far my favorite part of the game, in fact they could take everything away (except the versus mode of course) and just keep this section, and the game will still be awesome.

      "I don't mind the exclusion of a campaign, even if these are what the series is known for, but it is still unfortunate due to the quality of the sole such co-op mission after the string of alibi tutorials. The sequel will certainly have one and this sub-series should be renamed to S.W.A.T. due to the similar nature of this game to that dead franchise. The multiplayer mode is pretty fascinating and the unique gameplay is rock solid but the lack of content and customization is noticeable. The game thus feels somewhat uncompleted for a full price game yet i will come back for the sequel and will stick around longer if it will feature more content.\n",

      "I bought this for cheap as a fan of Sega's work, though I wasn't expecting much since it leans so much on movement and motion, which can get very tiresome, and it does, but that doesn't make Rise of Nightmares a bad game. Actually, quite the contrary, because Rise of Nightmares shows how Kinect can offer a meaty single player game and not just little mini-game collections. While Kinect has some fantastic games like The Gunstringer and Fruit Ninja Kinect, in addition to the upcoming Crimson Dragon from the creators of Panzer Dragoon, I think Rise of Nightmares is good proof that a game like this can work with motion controls. Similar to Haunt (another solid Kinect game, now available on Xbox Live Arcade) but with more depth, Rise of Kinect offers full 3D movement and lots of weapon and environmental interaction. With a fun and campy story, solid gameplay, some pretty good graphics, and some good ol' horror, I think Rise of Nightmares is a great game for fans of House of the Dead. My one and only complaint is that you can get a little sore playing it for extended lengths.\n",

Instead of skill points, you work with anomalies to increase your abilities, upgrade your equipment, and improve your weapons.

On the other hand, careful use of ammunition for the same weapon makes a difference (standard rounds while walking around the countryside to deal with blind dogs, etc.; armor piercing for dealing with humans) and might be the root of some folks' problems with one shot-one kill situations. Avoid full automatic fire as almost all rounds other than the first will be into the air, particularly with the AK series, unless you are face to face.\n",

On the other hand, you begin to count on encountering them in the same places, which is unfortunate. Roaming bands of neutrals and bandits appear, though they seem to follow the same paths.

That is the whole reason we bought this game was to sit in those cars and race but unfortunately, playing the game is nearly impossible with those things.

      "After seeing the movie industry time and time again come up with the worst batman's in history (I'm still debating if Val Kilmer or George Clooney take the price) and reading lots and lots of great comics and watching great animated series, finally a company comes along and rewards us fans with a marvelous dark knight game that truly puts you in Wayne's mind as the Batman. No, this is not the BAM, WHAM, KA-POW batman you saw David West in and it's not the weird new batman from Batman the Brave and the Bold cartoon and that is such a relief !!\n",
      "This is the TRUE Batman, the one Bob Kane had in his mind even in the late 30's, the one that has inspired great writings from comic book authors such as Jeph Loeb (The Long Halloween), Frank Miller (Year One) and Grant Morrison (Arkham Asylum). Taking most of the game heavily from the Arkham Asylum comic book, this game truly compels the player in a gritty, Gothic, depressing place that is the former house of the Arkham family. Some may think the mansion may be a bit small to create a game in seeing games as Fallout 3, GTA, or the Total War series yet the Arkham Mansion is now so much more than just a house and has been cleverly designed in the game with the help of Waynetech Industries. The single player campaign is a great story worthy of a comic book of it's own and let's not forget the greatest Joker since I read Alan Moore's The Killing Joke (and yes I'm including Heath Ledger here, he's just too darn psycho to be the ultimate joker, although I admit he stole the leading role in the movie), Mark Hamill is and will always be the greatest joker voice I've heard and of course Kevin Conroy does a marvelous job as the Batman. But it's the little things that this game excels at, whether is the Joker screaming madly while dancing before signaling Harley to lock Arkham, or Batman's knuckle crunching sounds when he breaks a goon's arm in two this game gives the player so much more than a mere punch and kick experience. Whether you're the action packed super hero that loves to beat everyone to a pulp or the stealthy guy that likes a kill without been seen you'll find your need in this game.\n",
      "The only bad parts that I may think of are the installation, it took me 4 tries to get the Games for Windows Live installed and even though I couldn't care less about online leaderboards I have to create an account otherwise I can't save my progress, that's just absurd but it's not the developers fault.\n",
      "The solo campaign is rather small compared to games nowadays even compared to some old ones with almost the same style like the Hitman series, yet the quality of the game story and the graphics makes this shortcomings well worth the hassle. But for this two shortcomings I had to deduct those two stars otherwise the game will be rated as flawless and nothing is flawless.\n",
      "Now if you really think the game lacks depth because you finished the campaign too soon, well try the Riddler challenges and you'll soon find yourself playing well over 50 hours just trying to figure out some of the puzzles. The trophies are really easy to find and most of them only require the adequate equipment in your arsenal, but the character bios and the arkham chronicles really require you to think and even delve into some of the comics to solve them and see what makes the batman villains tick. The question mark puzzles are more a matter of proper camera placing but are as engaging as the character ones nonetheless.\n",
      "Overall I do think this has become a classic of the gaming industry and a revolution on the way FPS games should be in the future. As far as the Batman Universe goes, it has been the first time I felt truly connected to Batman as a character, I won't spoil the story but to truly understand Bruce Wayne and why he created his alter ego the Scarecrow parts are really amazing.\n",

You can kind of explore the city and screw around a little bit between missions if you want to, but it really follows a more linear path and has a pretty set storyline to it...your a war hero returned home who, accompanied by a close friend, work their way into the Mob and work their way up the latter...lots of hand to hand combat and stealing stuff and shooting thugs.  Those are the primary 3 things you will be doing in your missions on this game.  While it's not as open, in depth, and big as GTA IV, this is still an enjoyable game, and if you're into gangster & crime games, you should still at least give this game a play through.

      "\n",
      "First of all... if you are well versed on RPGs, then immediately set the difficulty on Hard.  It will not actually be 'hard' but there will be a slight bit of challenge in battle.  On 'normal' the battles are easy and excruciatingly boring.  Even on hard, the baddies will usually hit for 1-6 damage unless they use a powerful Persona ability.\n",
      "\n",
      "Okay.  First thing I noticed was that the music is amazing.  I'm talking about some of the best music in a handheld video game period.  The music is a more modern rock-centric style.  Lots of guitar, some distortion, but all really high quality and very catchy.  The music fits the setting very well.  There are also some fun little additions such as an actual classical piano piece (Debussy I believe) that plays in the Velvet room (it plays after the first piece ends).  Battle music is fast paced and works well without being too repetitive.\n",
      "\n",
      "Graphics are a pretty standard PS1 port style.  Though some areas have been tweaked, overall the flow is a lot smoother than PS1 and the camera can be rotated to eight points.  The characters are standard 2d PS1 style sprites (think Xenogears) and the field is isometric 3-d.  Battles take place on pretty boring and bland fields with some swirling, sinister looking 'clouds', but you're really focusing on the action I guess.\n",
      "\n",
      "Installing some of the data onto the memory card really speeds up loading times.  Especially the battle loading speeds.  Before installing you had to wait 3-8 seconds for battle to start once you saw the white flash.  With installation, the load is about 1-3 seconds.  Also speed in battle has improved.  There is no real slowdown when contacting demons or executing attacks like before installation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Battle is simple turn based, yet is fun.  Encounter rates are high-ish.  There is a FFX style turn indicator on the right so you can plan out your attack.  You can change your turn order, but often this pushes the demons' attacks higher on the turn order.  If you interrupt battle to re-input commands, then the turns start at that person's turn.  It's still turn based, but this allows some customization.  Especially useful for Fusion spells.\n",
      "\n",
      "The real fun is in making contact with demons in order to gain cards, pacts, money, items, or information.  You select a character or multiple characters and have them perform an action towards a demon.  My favorite would have to be Tatsuya's impression of a fighter jet.  I recommend NOT using a guide since it's fun to see demon's get angry and call you names, or become frightened and cower.  I even found that despite getting a demon to become 'eager' and give me valuable cards, I would later get that demon riled up in order to see their reaction.  But remember, if all you do is contact demons and gain cards and pacts, then you won't level up.  So you have to beat some up at some point!\n",
      "\n",
      "Summoning and using Persona's is a lot of fun, and this is where the game really shines.  Each character can use one Persona at a time.  You gain a level up bonus that is unique to each Persona.  To get new Persona's, you collect Tarot cards and trade them in at the Velvet room.  Using different Persona's gives access to different techniques as well as different Fusion spells (important spells combining 2+ Persona techniques to unleash a more devastating attack - very useful in those tough boss battles).  Often a character's regular attack is ineffective, so using Persona's is mandatory.  As you use Persona's they gain ranks and eventually gain more abilities.  You can trade in maxed out Persona's for items or cards when you are done and then summon a new version of that Persona (using your cards though) and get them to max out again.  A useful way to gain items or stats.\n",
      "\n",
      "The story is top notch and will keep you interested.  There is a TON of dialogue and lots of interesting character interaction.  The characters are all pretty interesting and you really get a feel for their personalities and even can sympathize with them.  The story doesn't seem really outlandish once you get into it.  Basically this Joker person is going around and making peoples' wishes come true.  This is through the use of rumor.  When a rumor gets going, it actually becomes true.  So there is a rumor that Seven High's school emblems are cursed... and then they actually do become cursed.  Some rumors help your party too.  Such as a rumor that you can spread about a Ramen shop selling weapons, or another shop being a mafia fencing operation, or a secret labyrinth on the second floor of a night club that houses some good items.  So spreading rumors can be beneficial, though often you have to make a choice as to which you spread (the shop sells good weapons at fair prices, sells amazing weapons that are expensive, sells average weapons for cheap, etc... then the shop will sell the selection indicated by which rumor was spread).\n",

      "\n",
      "Everything else is exactly the same.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once you've played this game or the 2004 edition once, you've pretty much played all you can play it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The issues are almost haphazardly aligned and shifted mid-game, to a point where you could make a TV ad in a state stating your opposition to high gas prices, only to a few weeks later start to lose awareness there because all of a sudden they SUPPORT high gas prices.  Not only is this clear insanity/stupidity since NO ONE supports high gas prices these days save for the occasional one or two out of ten people or more.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the end issues don't even matter; all your speeches and ads can be about supporting the economy or supporting the environment or some other PC universal BS issue that no one could possibly oppose without being declared legally insane by the public and you'll never need to become a \"divider\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Interviews consist basically of answering true to your base.  That is, if you're a Republican, you answer a question with the most insanely wrong answer that is most insensitive and stupid (such as sending military forces to the US-Mexico border, being gung-ho about terrorism, thinking gay marriage is \"icky\"), whereas if you're a Democrat, you answer a question with the most insanely wrong answer that is most hippie-liberal politically correct with peace love and flowers for all.  If you don't head primarily one way, you lose the audience and risk damage to your national awareness.\n",
      "\n",
      "The campaign starts off easily, and rather than gradually increase the difficulty, it instead keeps the gameplay AI exactly the same, with the only difficulty being that suddenly your state awareness is cut back, while your opponent's stays the same.\n",
      "\n",
      "This means that in one level in a state at the start of the game, you and your opponent can be 50-50 in the polls, and several levels later, at the very beginning, for no reason, you're down to 39%-50%\n",
      "\n",
      "And working to build up awareness percentages in the DOUBLE digits is almost completely impossible.  You're guaranteed to lose all the states unless you gain all the endorsements available and spend all your money on ads and campaign buildings.\n",
      "\n",
      "In that way, it thinks it is being more difficult with each level, when really it's only rigging the game against you, to a point where succeeding to the next level is impossible unless you cheat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then there's bias:  Yes, even this game has bias.  As much as they may deny it or make it subtle, it's there: Republican issues and Republican endorsements are more effective on neutral states than Democratic issues and endorsements.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example: the Gun Lobby endorsement, a Republican endorsement, gives you a highly noticeable boost in almost every southern state from Florida to Texas.  The Women's Lobby endorsement, a Democratic endorsement, gives you almost no boost anywhere but California, which is already heavily Democratic to begin with.\n",
      "\n",
      "This would seemingly not be of such concern since Republicans can get Democratic endorsements and such, except for the fact that an opposite-party endorsement costs MORE political experience points.  Example: if you're a Democrat with 10 experience points, you can afford a Democratic endorsement for 10 points, but a Republican endorsement costs 13 points for you, whereas it costs 10 for your opponent, and Democratic endorsements cost 13 for him/her.\n",

In my house we all have our own DS's so our favorite part of this game is mario vs. luigi where you can play against someone else on their DS. It is sooooo much fun!! I highly recommend this one.

We have a 72% agreement ratio between the two methods which is a relatively high level of consistency between two methods. In 72% of the cases, the method classifies as positive, neutral, or negative sentiment aligning with TextBlob's classification. In 28% of the reviews, there is a discrepancy between two methods. This could be due to various factors, such as difference in how each method interprets the sentiment conveyed in the text, overall = by human, and text blob by machine learning model.\n",
